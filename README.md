# Task Management API (Ÿçsecurity)

This project is an advanced Task Management API built using Laravel. It includes features such as task dependencies, advanced security mechanisms, and user role management. This API allows users to manage tasks efficiently with support for various task types, priorities, and dependencies between tasks.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, and manage tasks with types like Bug, Feature, and Improvement.
- **Task Dependencies**: Automatically block tasks that depend on incomplete tasks and unblock them when dependencies are resolved.
- **User Management & Roles**: Assign tasks to users and manage user permissions based on roles.
- **Task Status Tracking**: Track task status updates with history logging.
- **File Attachments**: Upload and manage attachments related to tasks.
- **Daily Reports**: Generate daily task reports with performance insights.
- **Security**: Implement JWT authentication, rate limiting, and protection against common attacks like XSS, SQL Injection, and CSRF.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Comprehensive error logging and custom exception handling.
